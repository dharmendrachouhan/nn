## General Information

Problem statement: To build a CNN based model which can accurately detect melanoma. Melanoma is a type of cancer that can be deadly if not detected early. 
It accounts for 75% of skin cancer deaths. A solution which can evaluate images and alert the dermatologists about the presence of melanoma has the potential to reduce a lot of manual effort needed in diagnosis.

## Conclusions

Summary of the model
- The model has test accuracy of 54%
- The model has test accuracy 57%
- Using CNN we could create a model which can classify skin cancer type
   
## Technologies Used
- numpy - version 1.26.4
- pandas - version 2.1.4
- matplotlib - version 3.8.0
- statsmodels - version 0.14.0
